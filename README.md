# Tableau-Practice
The Study Material prepared here is solely for Learning Purpose..,

There are 3 Main Folders containing Files :

1) Processes : Consists number of files with '.IPYNB' extention, which can open in Jupyter Notebook. Every file consists of a Process given in detail with cropped images from Tableau & explained wherever necessary for better understanding.

Kindly note that this is just a material which I found & prepared during my own practices, so this is not the final one. And there are topics which I've not prepared with material ready for study due to time. You can cintribute to this repository with the study material, so that anyone can learn..,
